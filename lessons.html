									<h1>Project Lessons</h1>
								</header>
								<p><b>Introduction:</b> Welcome to the lessons page of the Virtual Arcade System Software Project! This poject
										is a great opportunity to get started with object oriented programming in C++ regardless of your programming experience. If you are a beginner, don't worry! These lessons 
										will guide you through every step of building this project. Now let's get started!</p>
										<p><b><i>Note: This project does not assume any prior programming experience. However, this is not
											an easy project and may require you to spend time reading through these lessons and other resources I have linked if you have 
											little to no programming experience.</i></b> 
										</br><hr><h2>Lesson 0: Environment setup (completion time: 30 minutes)</h2> 
										<b>Overview:</b> Before we do anything, we need to set up an environment in which we can program in. This step is very important,
										so please read and follow every instruction carefully. This setup can be very frustrating if you 
										miss a step or something goes wrong so please be patient and email me with any questions. </p>
										
										
										<h4>1. Downloading a code editor</h4> No matter what language you use, when building a software project you need an environment where you can write code. For this project
								we will be using Visual Studio Code which is a free code editor with tools and extensions that will help us build our project. Follow <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">this link</a>
							and download the according version (Windows or Mac).<br></br>
							
							<ul>
								<li>On <b>Windows</b>, an installation setup wizard should pop up (if not it will appear as something similar to "VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.38.1.exe" in your downloads folder, double click it). Just hit next through the setup
									and leave the default settings unless you want to configure the installation in a certain way.</li>
								<li>On <b>Mac</b> it should show up in your downloads. Move the Visual Studio Code .app into 
									your applications folder and then open up the app.</li>
							  </ul>

							<h4>2. Configuring Visual Studio Code for C++</h4>After installing Visual Studio Code we need to configure it so that we can develop in C++. Open it up if you haven't already and click the extensions icon (under the debug icon) in the left side bar. 
						Search for C++, click the first extension, and install it as shown in this image. <img src="images/extensions_img.jpg" alt="" style="float: left; width: 100%; margin-right: 1%;">This extension helps us write C++ code but does not come with a C++ compiler which we need to be able to run our code.
						 A compiler is a program that takes our C++ code and translates it into lower level code which we will use to make an executable program. Setting up  Visual Studio Code with a C++
						compiler will be different based on your OS so follow the steps based on what computer you are using.
					</p>
					<h3>Windows</h3>
					<p><img src="images/mingw_img.jpg" alt="" style="float: right; width: 40%; margin-left: 1%">
						<ol>Unfortunately Windows does not come with a C++ compiler so we will need to download some extra tools. We will be downloading MinGW which comes with a compiler, debugger, and a make utility, which we need to build this project. 
						<ol>
							</br><li>Download it at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/" target="_blank">this link</a>. After it downloads double click on the installer which should say something like "mingw-w64-install.exe" (check your downloads folder if it doesn't pop up and double click it like before). 
							</li> </br>
							<li>Click next through the installer setup and when you get to the "Installation folder" section as shown to the right, copy and paste the path of the destination folder into notepad or somewhere because we will need it. Continue through the rest of the setup and wait for it to install.
								</li>
							</br><li>Next we need to add the path to the "bin" folder for MinGW to our PATH so that we can access the tools from any directory. Follow these steps which reference the images below. 
								<ul>
									<li>
										search environment in the windows search bar and select "Edit the system environment variables"
									</li>
									<li>
											Click the "Environment Variables" button
									</li>
									<li>
												Then click the "path" row under "System Variables" and click the "edit" button
									</li>
									<li>
											Finally click the "New" button and paste the installation directory that we copied from before. IMPORTANT: make sure that you add "\mingw32\bin" at the end after you paste. Click "ok" on all the open tabs.
								    </li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ol>

								<div class="column">
								  <img src="images/env1.jpg" alt="" style="float: left; width: 50%; margin-right: 1%;margin-bottom: 3%;">
								  <img src="images/env2.jpg" alt="" style="float: left; width: 50%; margin-right: 1%;margin-bottom: 3%;">
								  <img src="images/env3.jpg" alt="" style="float: left; width: 50%; margin-right: 1%;margin-bottom: 3%;">	
								  <img src="images/env4.jpg" alt="" style="float: left; width: 50%; margin-right: 1%;margin-bottom: 3%;">								</div>

								<div class="column">
							  </div>
						 <br></br> Now we need to configure Visual Studio Code with the C++ compiler g++ that comes with MinGW by editing a properties file. To do this we need to go to the Command pallete by clicking View -> Command Pallette or CTRL + SHIFT + P. In the search bar type C++ and click the "Edit Configurations (UI)" option. A new tab will open called C/C++ Configurations. Scroll down to the "Compiler Path" section and click on the drop down menu. g++ should show up as an option, click it and make sure to put double quotes around the path. Under intelliSense mode choose "msvc-x64". Our environment is finally setup for C++ so let's check it to make sure it works. Go to File -> New File and type test.cpp. Copy and paste the following code. Then in te terminal type this command and press enter. Finally run it by doing this command. If you get this output then C++ is working correctly with Visual Studio Code. If not, check to make sure all the steps are correct. If you get funky errors, send me an email or come to my office hour. Otherwise, let's move on to the next step.
					<br></br> The next step is to set up the SDL2 library. This librar provides us with many functions that we will use to do things like creating windows, display graphics, capture user input, and much more which 
					would otherwise be very difficult to do from scratch. To set up this library we need files... I have already packaged all these to make the process simple in a repository online. To access This
					we need a tool called git. Git is a version control tool which means ... We can store code remotely and locally. We are going to get the remote code and put it locally. It has all the stuff we need.
