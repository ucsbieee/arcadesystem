								<p><b>Introduction:</b> Welcome to the lessons page of the Virtual Arcade System Software Project! This poject
										is a great opportunity to apply object oriented programming in C++. If you are a beginner, don't worry! These lessons 
										will help guide you through the process of building this project.
								</p>
										<p>
											<b><i>Note: This project does not assume any prior programming experience. However, this is not
											an easy project and may require you to spend time reading through these lessons and other resources I have linked if you have 
											little to no programming experience.</i></b> 
											<a name="Lesson0"></a>
											</br><hr><h2>Lesson 0: Environment setup (completion time: 15 min - 45min)</h2> 
											<i>For terms or concepts that may require additional explanation, I have provided clickable links to simple articles that provide more detail.</i>
											<br></br>
											<b>Overview:</b> Before we do anything, we need to set up an environment in which we can program in. This step is very important,
											so please read and follow every instruction carefully. This setup can be very frustrating if you 
											miss a step or something goes wrong so please be patient and email me with any questions. 
										</p>
										
										
										<h4>1. Downloading a code editor</h4>
										 No matter what language you use, when building a software project you need an environment where you can write code. For this project
										 we will be using Visual Studio Code which is a free code editor with tools and extensions that will help us build our project. Follow <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">this link</a>
										 and download the according version (Windows or Mac).<br></br>
							
										<ul>
											<li>On <b>Windows</b>, an installation setup wizard should pop up (if not it will appear as something similar to "VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.38.1.exe" in your downloads folder, double click it). Just hit next through the setup
												and leave the default settings unless you want to configure the installation in a certain way.</li>
											<li>On <b>Mac</b> it should show up in your downloads as a .zip. Double click on this to extract the archive. Move the Visual Studio Code application into 
												your applications folder and then open up the app.</li>
										</ul>

										<h4>2. Configuring Visual Studio Code for C++</h4>
							After installing Visual Studio Code we need to configure it so that we can develop in C++. Open it up if you haven't already and click the extensions icon (under the debug icon) in the left side bar. 
						Search for C++, click the first extension, and install it as shown in this image. <img src="images/extensions_img.jpg" alt="" style="float: left; width: 100%; margin-right: 1%;">This extension helps us write C++ code but does not come with a C++ compiler.
						 A compiler is a program that takes our C++ code and translates it into lower level "object code" which we will use to make an executable program. </br><b><i>For a better explanation of a compiler <a href="https://www.coronadoenterprises.com/tutorials/cpp/cpp_ans.html" target="_blank">click here</a></i></b>. </br>Setting up  Visual Studio Code with a C++
						compiler will be different based on your OS so follow the steps based on your computer.
						<br></br><h4>3. Setting up Visual Studio Code with a C++ compiler</h4>
						<center>
						</br>	<a href="#Windows">Windows</a>
								&nbsp;|&nbsp;

						<a name="Windows"></a>	
				<br>	<h3>Windows</h3> 
<p><img src="images/mingw_img.jpg" alt="" style="float: right; width: 40%; margin-left: 1%">
						Unfortunately Windows does not come with a C++ compiler so we will need to download some extra tools. We will be downloading MinGW which comes with a compiler, debugger, and a make utility, which we need to build this project. 
						
						<ol>
								<h4>Setting up MinGW</h4>
							<li>Download it at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/" target="_blank">this link</a>. After it downloads double click on the installer which should say something like "mingw-w64-install.exe" (check your downloads folder if it doesn't pop up and double click it like before). 
							</li> </br>
							<li>Click next through the installer setup and when you get to the <b>"Installation folder"</b> section as shown to the right, change the path to C:\MinGW. Continue through the rest of the setup and wait for it to install.
								</li>
							</br><li>Next we need to add the MinGW "bin" folder's path to our PATH variable so that we can access the tools from any directory. 
								<i><br></br><a href="https://john-dugan.com/path-variable-in-windows/" target="_blank"> What is the PATH variable?</a> </br>Note: "path" vs "path variable". "path" typically refers to a location in a file system like "C:\Users\userOne\Documents\file.txt"</i><br></br>Follow these five steps which each reference the five images below. 
								<ol>
									<li>
										search environment in the windows search bar and select "Edit the system environment variables"
									</li>
									<li>
											Click the "Environment Variables" button
									</li>
									<li>
												Then click the "path" row under "System Variables" and click the "edit" button
									</li>
									<li>
											Finally click the "New" button and type "C:\MinGW\mingw32\bin". Then click "ok" on all the open tabs.
									</li>
									<li>To test if you configured the PATH variable correctly, open the command prompt (search cmd in the windows search bar) and type "g++". You should get something like: "g++: fatal error: no input files compilation terminated."</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>

						</div>
						<h4>Setting up Visual Studio Code with g++ (still windows)</h4>
						  Now we need to configure Visual Studio Code with the C++ compiler g++ that comes with MinGW by editing a properties file. However, first we must create and open a folder where we want these 
						 configuration settings to take effect.
						 <ul>
							 <li>create a new folder on your computer, then in VS Code go to File->Open Folder and open that folder</li>
							 <li>Now go to the Command pallete by clicking View -> Command Pallette or CTRL + SHIFT + P.</li>
							 <li>In the search bar type C++ and click the "Edit Configurations (UI)" option. A new tab will open called C/C++ Configurations.</li>
							 <li>Scroll down to the "Compiler Path" section and type "C:/MinGW/mingw32/bin/g++" in with the quotes.</li>
							 <li>Under intelliSense mode choose "gcc-x64".</li>
							 <img src="images/config_img.jpg" alt="" style="float: left; width: 100%; margin-right: 1%;">
						 </ul>
						 
						 <h4>Testing if C++ works with Visual Studio Code on Windows</h4>
						  Our environment is finally setup for C++ so let's check it to make sure it works.
						 <ul>
							 <li>Go to File -> New File. Save with CTRL + S and it will prompt you to name it, save as test.cpp</li>
							 <li>Copy and paste the following code: 
<pre><code>#include &ltiostream&gt
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	cout << "If this prints then you have set up C++ correctly!";
	return 0;
}
</pre></code></li>
							 <li>Go to Terminal -> New Terminal, press enter, and type the following commands:
<pre><code>g++ -o test test.cpp
.\test
</pre></code>

<h3>MAC</h3>	
<p>Fortunately, setting up C++ to compile on a Mac is much easier than Windows because Mac has an easy way to install "command line developer tools" which will provide us with utilities like clang (C++ compiler) and Make.
		<h4>Downloading command line developer tools on Mac</h4>
		<ol>
				<li>
					open the search by using Command + Space. Type in "Terminal" and press enter to open it up
				</li>
				<li>
						In the terminal install the Command line tools with the command "xcode-select --install" Make sure you only install the tools and NOT xcode.
				</li>
				<li>
						Now type clang and make sure you get something like "$ clang: error: no input files"
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Configuring Visual Studio Code with g++</h4>
		<ol>
				<li>
					First we need to set up Visual Studio Code to open from the command line. In VS code use CTRL + SHIFT + P to open up the command pallete or go to View -> Command Pallete
				</li>
				<li>
						Now type Shell and select "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH." After it installs close VS code.
				</li>
				<li>
							Now open up the terminal if you closed it and type "mkdir testFolder" to make a new folder. Enter that folder by typing "cd testFolder". Finally type "Code ." to open up this folder in VS Code.
				</li>
				<li>
						Open the command pallette like before and type C++ and select  "Edit Configurations (UI)". A new tab called C/C++ Configurations will open up. In this tab scroll down to "compiler path" and paste "/usr/bin/clang". Also make sure intellisense is "clang-x64" as shown.
						<img src="images/macConfig.png" alt="" style="float: left; width: 100%; margin-right: 1%;">
			</li>
			<li>C++ is finally configured! Now let's test to make sure it works.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Testing C++ on MAC</h4>
			Go to File -> New File. Save with CTRL + S and it will prompt you to name it, save as test.cpp</li>
							 <li>Copy and paste the following code: 
<pre><code>#include &ltiostream&gt
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	cout << "If this prints then you have set up C++ correctly!";
	return 0;
}
</pre></code></li>
							 <li>Go to Terminal -> New Terminal, press enter, and type the following commands:
<pre><code>g++ -o test test.cpp
./test
</pre></code>

	<h4>4. Managing a new project using Git and linking to the SDL2 library</h4>
	
	Now that we have our code editor working with C++ we can start a project. When creating mid to large size
	programming projects with multiple files, we want to manage our code with a tool called Git and save our code online using
	a site called Github.<br></br>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Git</b> is known as a version control system and it is used to manage software in a container called a repository.
			For example, say you make some changes to working code and break it. Using Git, you can see
			every change and undo them if necessary. More on this later.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Github</b> on the other hand is a service to store and manage your Git repositories online.
		</li>
	</ul>  <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-version-control/" target="_blank">What is version control?</a>    <a href="https://blog.devmountain.com/git-vs-github-whats-the-difference/" target="_blank">Git vs GitHub</a>

	<br></br></br>I have created a repository (basically a directory to store a project) on github with some base code which we will build off of. This base code includes build tasks,
the SDL2 library, and a small set of classes I created to help create a simple menu system. What we will be doing is copying the base code into a local directory
on your computer and start from there. <br></br>
<ol>
	<li>
		first download git if you don't have it already <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">from this link.</a> In the installation 
		wizard just click next through all the steps and install it.
	</li>
	<li>
		next, create an account on github if you don't have one already <a href="https:github.com/" target="_blank">from this link</a>
	</li>
	<li> The next thing we need to do is configure git with our information. Type these commands into the command prompt (terminal) with your name and email. 
	</br> git config --global user.name "firstName lastName"</br>
		  git config --global user.email "email@website.com"
		
	</li>
	<li>
		Now that git is configured let's copy the base code to your local computer from github. Open the command prompt (terminal)
		and navigate to a location where you want to save your project. This may be documents, desktop, or anywhere else you
		want. Once in the location you want type this command:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Windows: </b> "git clone https://github.com/geffencooper/ArcadeSystem_windows.git"
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Mac: </b> "git clone https://github.com/geffencooper/ArcadeSystem_mac.git"
		</li>
		
	</ul> 

	<li>
		Now type "cd ArcadeSystem_windows" or "cd ArcadeSystem_mac", and then type "dir" if on Windows and "ls" if on Mac.
		You should see the following folders: <b>GUI_files, SDL_files, source </b>
	</li>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Mac</b>: If you are on Mac there is an extra step. Copy and paste the following commands ONE AT A TIME in your current directory
		which should be in the ArcadeSystem_mac folder.

		<pre><code>
			cd SDL_files
			/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
			brew install SDL2 SDl2_image SDL2_ttf SDl2_mixer
			cp -R /usr/local/Cellar/sdl2/2.0.10/include/SDL2/ include/
			cp -R /usr/local/Cellar/sdl2/2.0.10/lib/ lib/
			cp -R /usr/local/Cellar/sdl2_image/2.0.5/include/SDL2/ include/
			cp -R /usr/local/Cellar/sdl2_image/2.0.5/lib/ lib/
			cp -R /usr/local/Cellar/sdl2_ttf/2.0.15/include/SDL2/ include/
			cp -R /usr/local/Cellar/sdl2_ttf/2.0.15/lib/ lib/
			cp -R /usr/local/Cellar/sdl2_mixer/2.0.4/include/SDL2/ include/
			cp -R /usr/local/Cellar/sdl2_mixer/2.0.4/lib/ lib/
		</code></pre>
	</li>

</ol>
</p>

<h4>5. Testing to see if SDL2 works</h4>
<ol>
	<li>
		Open up Visual Studio code and go to File->Open Folder and open the according folder, "ArcadeSystem_windows" or "ArcadeSystem_mac"
	</li>
	<li>
		Now use "CTRL (CMND on Mac) + SHIFT + B" to bring up a build task drop down. It should look like the following picture
		<img src="images/build.jpg" alt="" style="float: left; width: 100%; margin-right: 1%;">
	</li>
	<li>
		select "build all". Then type "CTRL (CMND on Mac) + SHIFT + B" and select "run ArcadeSystem"
	</li>
	<li>
		you should get a blank window that says ArcadeSystem at the top as shown
		<img src="images/output.jpg" alt="" style="float: left; width: 100%; margin-right: 1%;">
	</li>
	<li>
		That's it!
	</li>
</ol>

	<h4>Congradulations! You finished the environment setup. This is one of the more difficult and frustrating parts of building
	software projects so don't get discouraged, the rest of the project is much more fun. </h4>

<p>
</br><hr><h2>Lesson 1: Introducing the Menu System/Designing a GUI</h2> 
Before getting into the design, watch this video for a demo of what the Arcade System will look like.

<p>
	<h4>Intro</h4>
	For this project, the goal is to provide you with something which you can expand on so we will be building 
	a "base" version of the Arcade System with a simple menu system, one game (brick breaker), and some music. At the end,
	you will have the knowledge and opportunity to customize your Arcade by building your own games and adding your own images and music.
</p>

<p>
	<img src="images/mainMenu_img.jpg" alt="" style="float: right; width: 40%; margin-left: 1%"><h4>Designing a GUI </h4> <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/g/gui.htm" target = "blank"> What is a GUI</a></br>
	A GUI is a "Graphical User Interface" and is the way we interact with a program. We will go through the steps of designing a simple GUI that will be used to interact with our
arcade system. However, due to time constraints we will not be programming this GUI from scratch. Instead we will just implement some files that I created
to help program the GUI.</br></br>
This image here on the right shows a visual of the GUI we will be making.	
</p>

<p>
</br></br>
	<h4>High Level Design</h4><img src="images/vision.jpg" alt="" style="float: right; width: 40%; margin-left: 1%">
	How do we go about desiging a menu system from scratch? </br></br>
	<ol>
		<li>	
				When building a multi file project, you don't want to start coding right away or you will end up with a bunch of messy code with no organization.
		</br></br>The first step is to start with the high level logic and design. Start with a sketch or diagram of 
		what you want your program to look like or how it might work. This image on the right is one of the early diagrams I made and represents a vision of what I wanted the arcade system to look like.
		</li></br>
		<li><img src="images/general.jpg" alt="" style="float: right; width: 40%; margin-left: 1%">
			The next step is to take the specific image or vision and generalize it a bit and break it down into components
			so that we can begin thinking in more of a programmatic way which makes the transition from design to implementation more fluid. Essentially,
			we want to take our design and consider how we can create some structure from it.
		</br></br> Consider this generalized diagram on the right. What does it resemble? It resembles
		a tree-like structure right. Now using this more generic diagram let's think about the structure of a tree. A tree starts with what we call the "root" and expands
		out into what we call "Nodes." Nodes are basically discrete points that hold data and are linked together to form the tree. Each box in the diagram is a node.
		
	</ol>
	<h4>Being more explicit with our design</h4>
	</li></br>
		<img src="images/hierarchy.jpg" alt="" style="float: right; width: 40%; margin-left: 1%">
		The next step is to get more explicit with our tree structure and start to define some rules and attributes.
		In our tree structure we will define something called the Node->Screen->Button hierarchy which basically are
		the three tiers of our menu system.
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Node</b>: The node represents an organizational unit in our menu system and does not really do anything more. Its role will become more clear but in general we
				can say that a node is a collection of screens.
			</li>
			<li>
					<b>Screen</b>: The screen represents the guts of the node and is where all the action happens. The top level user will be unaware of the nodes and will
					only interact with the screens. The screen also holds a list of buttons.
			</li>
			<li>
					<b>Button</b>: The button is what facilitates movement through the tree and is what actually links screens to screens and nodes to nodes.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>parent-child relationship of nodes</b>: We also need to define the connections between nodes. In this tree we are going
				to keep things simple and say that every "parent" node can have multiple "child" nodes, but every "child" node can only
				have one parent. Basically, every node can branch out into multiple nodes, but each node can only link to one node above itself. This way
				we avoid having loops in our tree.
			</li>
		</ul>
		This picture below shows this hierarchy in action. We have a tree made up of nodes (grey and yellow boxes), which hold screens (blue boxes), which are linked using buttons (green and red lines)
		and all the nodes follow the parent-child relationship we defined.
		<img src="images/tree.jpg" style="float: right; width: 100%; margin-left: 1%; margin-bottom:5%">
</p>
<p>
		<h4> Transitioning from design to implementation</h4>
		So now that we have a good idea of how our menu system is designed, let's go into the details of implementation because 
		this design needs to be described in code. So how do we do that? How do we take these attributes and rules that we used to describe our tree
		structure and make them into code? 
</br></br> <b>We use classes and create objects</b>
<br> We have already categorized our design into distinct parts that we can visualize (Node, Screen, Button) and described them. Now we can take all the attributes
and behaviors we associated with these parts and bundle them up into units which we call objects.
</br></br> For a quick intro about classes and objects in C++ click <a href="https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/object-class" target = "blank">this link</a>
</br></br>
<img src="images/classes.png" style="float: right; width: 50%; margin-left: 1%; margin-bottom:5%">For example, if we want to do something in our tree like move screens or play music how do we do that? We use the buttons. We can bundle up a set of attributes and behaviors associated with actions into a button object.
<ul>
	<li>
			In addition, we can bundle up the set of attributes and behaviors associated with the structure of our tree into screen and node objects
			
			
	</li>
	<li>
			So essentially in C++, an object is a unit that bundles up a set of attributes and behaviors. It is also helpful to think about objects in C++ as real life objects, so for example take a look at these classes to the right which are blueprints to define objects.
	</li>
	<li>
			Note how I described objects in two different ways
			<ol>
				<li>
						We can take a real life object and describe its behaviors and attributes so that we can implement it as a construct in our program
				</li>
				<li>
						Or we can take some high level abstract design and split it up into bundles of behaviors and attributes and form objects
						These are just two ways you can think about objects
				</li>
			</ol>
			
	</li>
</ul>
<h4> Defining the Node, Screen, and Button Classes</h4>
<p>
	I highly reccomend looking through "Button.h", "Screen.h", and "Node.h" in the GUI_files->headers folder inside our project folder. These files define
	a generic Button, Screen, and Node class. In summary:
</br> 
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Button Attributes: </b> width, height, x position, y position
	</br>
	<b>Button Methods: </b> Accessors, mutators, update, render </br>
	<a href="https://oop.tech-academy.co.uk/accessors-mutators/" target="blank">What are accessors and mutators</a>
	</li>
	<li>
			<b>Screen Attributes: </b> list of ArcadeTexture objects
		</br>
		<b>Screen Methods: </b> Accessors, mutators, update, render </br>
		</li>
		<li>
				<b>Node Attributes: </b> currentScreen object, list of screen objects, parent node object, renderer object
			</br>
			<b>Node Methods: </b> Accessors, mutators, update, render </br>
			</li>
</ul>
You are probably wondering what an Arcade Texture object is and what update and render do. I will get into that below.
</br>But before I do it is important to note how "generic" these classes are and by that I mean I only defined the most basic 
and general attributes and methods that a button, screen, or node should have without getting too specific. </br>
<h4>Inheritance</h4>This gives us the 
flexibility to create different types of buttons or screens or nodes that share the same general attributes but behave in a specific way through
<b>inheritance</b>. For a good explanation of inheritance in C++ read <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-c/" target = "blank">this article</a>
</br></br> So what I have done is inherited from the button class to create two different buttons (SimpleButton and OptionsButton) and inherited
from the screen class to create two different screens (MenuScreen and GameScreen). You can see these in the GUI_files->headers folder.
</br></br>
<h4> Understanding the GUI loop</h4>
So before we can start using the button, screen, and node objects to build our menu system we first have to understand how a GUI loop works.
A GUI loop is just a series of three steps that our program follows:
<ol>
	<li>
		<b>Handle Input</b>: First we want our GUI to track any user events such as mouse movement or keystrokes. We want our
		menu system to be able to react to these events accordingly
	</li>
	<li>
			<b>Update</b>: Next we need our GUI to update the states or values of certain variables based on te user input. For example, if the user move their mouse over a button we want to update
			the state of that button to "selected."

	<li>
			<b>Render</b>: Rendering just means painting to the screen. So for example, our button state was updated to selected so now when we render
			that button it will be rendered with some opacity to show that it is selcted.
	</li>
</ol>
This loop repeats over and over again 60 times per second for the entirety of our program.

To understand how this loop works in the context of our program take a look at this simplified main function which is where every C++ program begins.
<pre><code>
		int main(int argc, char* argv[])
		{   
			// initialize resources we need like the window
			if (!init())
			{
				printf("Failed to initialize!\n");
			}
			// if initializes successfully then continue
			else
			{
				// we want to run the gui loop until the user quits
				bool quit = false;

				// here we create the first node for our menu system
				Node* currentNode = new RootNode(arcadeSystemRenderer, nullptr);

				// ---------------THE GUI LOOP
				while (!quit)
				{   
					// handle all user events until there are none left
					SDL_Event e;
					while (SDL_PollEvent(&e) != 0)
					{
						// update the current node 
						currentNode->update(&e);

						// user requests quit by clicking window X
						if (e.type == SDL_QUIT)
						{
							quit = true;
						}
					}
					currentNode->update(nullptr);
					// render the current node
					currentNode->render(arcadeSystemRenderer);
					SDL_RenderPresent(arcadeSystemRenderer);
				}
			}
		
</code></pre>

<p>
	The GUI works like this
	<ol>
		<li>
			Before going into the loop, create the first node in the menu system.
			We hold it in a variable called currentNode because we only care about updating and rendering
			the current node. There is no point in updating and rendering the other nodes if we aren't using them.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now we enter the loop and run it until the user wants to quit
		</li>
		<li>
			Next we check for user events and pass them to the current node until there are no events left.
			When we update the currentNode it will call update for the currentSceen (again we only care about the current screen) which will
			check if a button is selected or not.
		</li>
		<li>
			If there are no events we still want to update the current node but just pass in no event
		</li>
		<li>
			Finally we render the node to the screen. Node will render the current screen, which will render all its ArcadeTexture objects and all its buttons.
		</li>
	</ol>

	An ArcadeTexture object is basically just an image or text that we want to put on the screen. I made a class called ArcadeTexture to simplify
	the process of doing this.

	<h4>conclusion</h4>
	That was a lot of information so don't worry if a lot of it didn't make sense. Next class we will be going over
	how to actually use these objects to create a menu system. </br></br><b>One important concept to remember is abstraction, it is not
	critical to understand how button, screen, and node work under the hood but rather it is important to know how to use them because at the end 
	of the day we just want to build the menu system. For example, its good to understand how a car generally works but you don't need to understand
all the details of how it works under the hood in order to use it. In this case I have implemented the GUI classes for you and abstracted all the details away by
providing a set of methods (we will learn these next class) for you to use to build a menu.</b>
