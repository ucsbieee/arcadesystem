									<h1>Project Lessons</h1>
								</header>
								<p><b>Introduction:</b> Welcome to the lessons page of the Virtual Arcade System Software Project! This poject
										is a great opportunity to apply object oriented programming in C++. If you are a beginner, don't worry! These lessons 
										will help guide you through the process of building this project.
								</p>
										<p>
											<b><i>Note: This project does not assume any prior programming experience. However, this is not
											an easy project and may require you to spend time reading through these lessons and other resources I have linked if you have 
											little to no programming experience.</i></b> 
											</br><hr><h2>Lesson 0: Environment setup (completion time: 15 min - 45min)</h2> 
											<i>For terms or concepts that may require additional explanation, I have provided clickable links to simple articles that provide more detail.</i>
											<br></br>
											<b>Overview:</b> Before we do anything, we need to set up an environment in which we can program in. This step is very important,
											so please read and follow every instruction carefully. This setup can be very frustrating if you 
											miss a step or something goes wrong so please be patient and email me with any questions. 
										</p>
										
										
										<h4>1. Downloading a code editor</h4>
										 No matter what language you use, when building a software project you need an environment where you can write code. For this project
										 we will be using Visual Studio Code which is a free code editor with tools and extensions that will help us build our project. Follow <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">this link</a>
										 and download the according version (Windows or Mac).<br></br>
							
										<ul>
											<li>On <b>Windows</b>, an installation setup wizard should pop up (if not it will appear as something similar to "VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.38.1.exe" in your downloads folder, double click it). Just hit next through the setup
												and leave the default settings unless you want to configure the installation in a certain way.</li>
											<li>On <b>Mac</b> it should show up in your downloads as a .zip. Double click on this to extract the archive. Move the Visual Studio Code application into 
												your applications folder and then open up the app.</li>
										</ul>

										<h4>2. Configuring Visual Studio Code for C++</h4>
							After installing Visual Studio Code we need to configure it so that we can develop in C++. Open it up if you haven't already and click the extensions icon (under the debug icon) in the left side bar. 
						Search for C++, click the first extension, and install it as shown in this image. <img src="images/extensions_img.jpg" alt="" style="float: left; width: 100%; margin-right: 1%;">This extension helps us write C++ code but does not come with a C++ compiler.
						 A compiler is a program that takes our C++ code and translates it into lower level "object code" which we will use to make an executable program. </br><b><i>For a better explanation of a compiler <a href="https://www.coronadoenterprises.com/tutorials/cpp/cpp_ans.html" target="_blank">click here</a></i></b>. </br>Setting up  Visual Studio Code with a C++
						compiler will be different based on your OS so follow the steps based on your computer.
						<br></br><h4>3. Setting up Visual Studio Code with a C++ compiler</h4>
						<center>
						</br>	<a href="#Windows">Windows</a>
								&nbsp;|&nbsp;
								<a href="#Mac">Mac</a>
						</center><hr>
						<a name="Windows"></a>	
				<br>	<h3>Windows</h3> 
<p><img src="images/mingw_img.jpg" alt="" style="float: right; width: 40%; margin-left: 1%">
						Unfortunately Windows does not come with a C++ compiler so we will need to download some extra tools. We will be downloading MinGW which comes with a compiler, debugger, and a make utility, which we need to build this project. 
						
						<ol>
								<h4>Setting up MinGW</h4>
							<li>Download it at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/" target="_blank">this link</a>. After it downloads double click on the installer which should say something like "mingw-w64-install.exe" (check your downloads folder if it doesn't pop up and double click it like before). 
							</li> </br>
							<li>Click next through the installer setup and when you get to the <b>"Installation folder"</b> section as shown to the right, change the path to C:\MinGW. Continue through the rest of the setup and wait for it to install.
								</li>
							</br><li>Next we need to add the MinGW "bin" folder's path to our PATH variable so that we can access the tools from any directory. 
								<i><br></br><a href="https://john-dugan.com/path-variable-in-windows/" target="_blank"> What is the PATH variable?</a> </br>Note: "path" vs "path variable". "path" typically refers to a location in a file system like "C:\Users\userOne\Documents\file.txt"</i><br></br>Follow these five steps which each reference the five images below. 
								<ol>
									<li>
										search environment in the windows search bar and select "Edit the system environment variables"
									</li>
									<li>
											Click the "Environment Variables" button
									</li>
									<li>
												Then click the "path" row under "System Variables" and click the "edit" button
									</li>
									<li>
											Finally click the "New" button and type "C:\MinGW\mingw32\bin". Then click "ok" on all the open tabs.
									</li>
									<li>To test if you configured the PATH variable correctly, open the command prompt (search cmd in the windows search bar) and type "g++". You should get something like: "g++: fatal error: no input files compilation terminated."</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>

								</div>
						</div>
						<h4>Setting up Visual Studio Code with g++ (still windows)</h4>
						  Now we need to configure Visual Studio Code with the C++ compiler g++ that comes with MinGW by editing a properties file. However, first we must create and open a folder where we want these 
						 configuration settings to take effect.
						 <ul>
							 <li>create a new folder on your computer, then in VS Code go to File->Open Folder and open that folder</li>
							 <li>Now go to the Command pallete by clicking View -> Command Pallette or CTRL + SHIFT + P.</li>
							 <li>In the search bar type C++ and click the "Edit Configurations (UI)" option. A new tab will open called C/C++ Configurations.</li>
							 <li>Scroll down to the "Compiler Path" section and type "C:/MinGW/mingw32/bin/g++" in with the quotes.</li>
							 <li>Under intelliSense mode choose "gcc-x64".</li>
							 <img src="images/config_img.jpg" alt="" style="float: left; width: 100%; margin-right: 1%;">
						 </ul>
						 
						 <h4>Testing if C++ works with Visual Studio Code on Windows</h4>
						  Our environment is finally setup for C++ so let's check it to make sure it works.
						 <ul>
							 <li>Go to File -> New File. Save with CTRL + S and it will prompt you to name it, save as test.cpp</li>
							 <li>Copy and paste the following code: 
<pre><code>#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	cout << "If this prints then you have set up C++ correctly!";
	return 0;
}
</pre></code></li>
							 <li>Go to Terminal -> New Terminal, press enter, and type the following commands:
<pre><code>g++ -o test test.cpp
.\test
</pre></code>
This image is what it should look like. If you get an error and can't figure it out please email me or come to my office hour.

<h3>MAC</h3>	
<p>Fortunately, setting up C++ to compile on a Mac is much easier than Windows because Mac has an easy way to install "command line developer tools" which will provide us with utilities like clang (C++ compiler) and Make.
		<h4>Downloading command line developer tools on Mac</h4>
		<ol>
				<li>
					open the search by using Command + Space. Type in "Terminal" and press enter to open it up
				</li>
				<li>
						In the terminal install the Command line tools with the command "xcode-select --install" Make sure you only install the tools and NOT xcode.
				</li>
				<li>
						Now type clang and make sure you get something like "$ clang: error: no input files"
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Configuring Visual Studio Code with g++</h4>
		<ol>
				<li>
					First we need to set up Visual Studio Code to open from the command line. In VS code use CTRL + SHIFT + P to open up the command pallete or go to View -> Command Pallete
				</li>
				<li>
						Now type Shell and select "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH." After it installs close VS code.
				</li>
				<li>
							Now open up the terminal if you closed it and type "mkdir testFolder" to make a new folder. Enter that folder by typing "cd testFolder". Finally type "Code ." to open up this folder in VS Code.
				</li>
				<li>
						Open the command pallette like before and type C++ and select  "Edit Configurations (UI)". A new tab called C/C++ Configurations will open up. In this tab scroll down to "compiler path" and paste "/usr/bin/clang". Also make sure intellisense is "clang-x64" as shown.
						<img src="images/macConfig.png" alt="" style="float: left; width: 100%; margin-right: 1%;">
			</li>
			<li>C++ is finally configured! Now let's test to make sure it works.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Testing C++ on MAC</h4>
			Go to File -> New File. Save with CTRL + S and it will prompt you to name it, save as test.cpp</li>
							 <li>Copy and paste the following code: 
<pre><code>#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	cout << "If this prints then you have set up C++ correctly!";
	return 0;
}
</pre></code></li>
							 <li>Go to Terminal -> New Terminal, press enter, and type the following commands:
<pre><code>g++ -o test test.cpp
./test
</pre></code>

	<h4>4. Managing a new project using Git and linking to the SDL2 library</h4>
	
	Now that we have our code editor working with C++ we can start a project. When creating mid to large size
	programming projects with multiple files, we want to manage our code with a tool called Git and save our code online using
	a site called Github.<br></br>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Git</b> is known as a version control system and it is used to manage software in a container called a repository.
			For example, say you make some changes to working code and break it. Using Git, you can see
			every change and undo them if necessary. More on this later.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Github</b> on the other hand is a service to store and manage your Git repositories online.
		</li>
	</ul>  <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-version-control/" target="_blank">What is version control?</a>    <a href="https://blog.devmountain.com/git-vs-github-whats-the-difference/" target="_blank">Git vs GitHub</a>

	<br></br></br>I have created a repository (basically a directory to store a project) on github with some base code which we will build off of. This base code includes build tasks,
the SDL2 library, and a small set of classes I created to help create a simple menu system. What we will be doing is copying the base code into a local directory
on your computer and start from there. <br></br>
<ol>
	<li>
		first download git if you don't have it already <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">from this link.</a> In the installation 
		wizard just click next through all the steps and install it.
	</li>
	<li>
		next, create an account on github if you don't have one already <a href="https:github.com/" target="_blank">from this link</a>
	</li>
	<li> The next thing we need to do is configure git with our information. Type these commands into the command prompt (terminal) with your name and email. 
	</br> git config --global user.name "firstName lastName"</br>
		  git config --global user.email "email@website.com"
		
	</li>
	<li>
		Now that git is configured let's copy the base code to your local computer from github. Open the command prompt (terminal)
		and navigate to a location where you want to save your project. This may be documents, desktop, or anywhere else you
		want. Once in the location you want type this command:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Windows: </b> "git clone https://github.com/geffencooper/ArcadeSystem_windows.git"
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Mac: </b> "git clone https://github.com/geffencooper/ArcadeSystem_mac.git"
		</li>
		
	</ul> 

	<li>
		Now type "cd ArcadeSystem_windows" or "cd ArcadeSystem_mac", and then type "dir" if on Windows and "ls" if on Mac.
		You should see the following folders: <b>GUI_files, SDL_files, source </b>
	</li>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Mac</b>: If you are on Mac there is an extra step. Copy and paste the following commands ONE AT A TIME in your current directory
		which should be in the ArcadeSystem_mac folder.

		<pre><code>
			cd SDL_files
			/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
			brew install SDL2 SDl2_image SDL2_ttf SDl2_mixer
			cp -R /usr/local/Cellar/sdl2/2.0.10/include/SDL2 include/
			cp -R /usr/local/Cellar/sdl2/2.0.10/lib/ lib/
			cp -R /usr/local/Cellar/sdl2_image/2.0.5/include/SDL2/ include/
			cp -R /usr/local/Cellar/sdl2_image/2.0.5/lib/ lib/
			cp -R /usr/local/Cellar/sdl2_ttf/2.0.15/include/SDL2/ include/
			cp -R /usr/local/Cellar/sdl2_ttf/2.0.15/lib/ lib/
			cp -R /usr/local/Cellar/sdl2_mixer/2.0.4/include/SDL2/ include/
			cp -R /usr/local/Cellar/sdl2_mixer/2.0.4/lib/ lib/
		</code></pre>
	</li>

</ol>
</p>

<h4>5. Testing to see if SDL2 works</h4>
<ol>
	<li>
		Open up Visual Studio code and go to File->Open Folder and open the according folder, "ArcadeSystem_windows" or "ArcadeSystem_mac"
	</li>
	<li>
		Now use "CTRL (CMND on Mac) + SHIFT + B" to bring up a build task drop down. It should look like the following picture
		<img src="images/build.jpg" alt="" style="float: left; width: 100%; margin-right: 1%;">
	</li>
	<li>
		select "build all". Then type "CTRL (CMND on Mac) + SHIFT + B" and select "run ArcadeSystem"
	</li>
	<li>
		you should get a blank window that says ArcadeSystem at the top as shown
		<img src="images/output.jpg" alt="" style="float: left; width: 100%; margin-right: 1%;">
	</li>
	<li>
		That's it!
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	<hr>
	<h4>Congradulations! You finished the environment setup. This is one of the more difficult and frustrating parts of building
	software projects so don't get discouraged, the rest of the project is much more fun. </h4>
