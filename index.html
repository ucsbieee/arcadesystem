								  <br></br><p><b>Overview:</b> This year's software project will teach you how to program a "Virtual Arcade System"
									in C++ using the SDL2 Library and a simple menu GUI (graphical user interface).
									As shown in the pictures above, you will be building an awesome Arcade System with a
									customizable menu system and classic games like brick breaker and tetris! Before getting
									started, read the paragraphs below to help you understand how this website and project is organized.
								  <br></br><b>Purpose:</b> While the majority of the project will be built during the guided lectures, this website
										contains all the information and resources you need. I strongly recommend that you read through the 
										"Lessons" tab after every lecture because I will not be able to go over everything in the limited
										amount of time we have. The lessons have detailed explanations and links to other
										resources to help you understand not only how to build this project, but also all the C++ programming and 
										design concepts around it.
										<br></br><b>Website Navigation:</b> This website has two other tabs, "Lessons" and "Documentation". The Lessons tab
									is a step by step guide on how to build this project and contains in depth explanations
									to help you learn and understand the basics of C++ object oriented programming as well as many 
									other useful programming tools and concepts. The Documentation tab contains a simple dictionary
									of functions that can be used to create a simple customizable menu system. I
									also put a link to a github repository with all the source code for this project as well as a possible
									questions section for any possible questions.
									<br></br><b>Getting Started:</b> To get started click the "Lessons" tab above. These lessons will guide you 
										through every step from setting up a C++ development environment, to managing your code with
										git, and finally building and running a fully functional program!
										<br></br><b>Questions:</b> Refer to the "Possible Questions" section in the documentation tab. You can also
										contact me through email at geffen_cooper@ucsb.edu for more specific questions or come to my
										office hours every Tuesday 3:30 - 4:30 PM.</p>
